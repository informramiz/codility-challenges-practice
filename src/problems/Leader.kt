     * in a smarter way. Notice that if the leader occurs somewhere in our sequence, then it must
     * occur at index n/2 (the central element). This is because, given that the leader occurs in more
     * than half the total values in the sequence, there are more leader values than will fit on either

     * is the candidate for leader.
     *
     * How to remove element pair?
     * After each such operation we check whether the two elements at the top of the stack are different.
     * If they are, we remove them from the stack. This is equivalent to removing a pair of different
     * elements from the sequence

     * Note: We don't need to actually use the stack data structure. All we need to remember is the last element
     * pushed to stack (last stack top) and the current size of the stack. Then in current iteration we can
     * compare the stack top with the current element to see if they are different and +/- the size of the stack
     * accordingly
