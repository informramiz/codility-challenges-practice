     * in a smarter way. Notice that if the leader occurs somewhere in our sequence, then it must
     * occur at index n/2 (the central element). This is because, given that the leader occurs in more
     * than half the total values in the sequence, there are more leader values than will fit on either
     * side of the central element in the sequence.
