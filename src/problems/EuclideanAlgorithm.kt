    /**
     * Binary Euclidean Algorithm:
     *
     * A binary algorithm for finding gcd(N,M) is based on the following
     * If N and M are even, gcd(N, M) = 2 gcd(N/2, M/2),
     * If N is even while M is odd, then gcd(N, M) = gcd(N/2, M),
     * If both N and M are odd, then (since N-M is even) |N-M| < max(N,M). Replace the largest of the two with |N-M|.
     *
     * Why is this algorithm more efficient?
     *
     * 1. The algorithm is known as binary because, unlike the original one, it does not use general division of integers
     * but only division by 2. Since in a computer numbers are represented in the Binary system anyway,
     * you should not be surprised to learn that there is a special machine instruction that implements division by 2
     * in a highly efficient manner. This is known as the right shift wherein the rightmost bit is discharged,
     * the remaining bits are shifted one place to the right and the leftmost bit is set to 0.
     *
     * 2. Another handy operation is a bitwise conjunction &. N & 1 is either 1 or 0 for any integer N. It's 1 iff N is odd.
     * Bitwise conjunction is also implemented in hardware, i.e., as a machine instruction.
     *

     *
     * NOTE: As in case if N and M are even,
     * gcd(N, M) = 2 gcd(N/2, M/2)
     * or as it can be = 2 * 2 * 2 ... gcd(N/2, M/2)
     * so we will write it as
     * gcd(N, M) = residual * gcd(N/2, M/2)
     * where residual can be any number multiple of 2
